Day 1 
Day 1 — Rethinking AI: From Answers to Decisions
Class goal:
 By the end of this session, students should clearly understand why Agentic AI exists and why traditional AI approaches break in real systems.
________________________________________
1. Why Today’s AI Is Still Mostly Passive 
Most AI systems today are reactive.
●	You ask a question → AI answers

●	You send input → AI produces output

●	The interaction ends

Even advanced models behave like stateless functions.
Technically:
●	No ownership of outcome

●	No memory beyond context window

●	No responsibility for what happens after output

This is fine for:
●	Chat

●	Content generation

●	One-off analysis

It fails for:
●	Long workflows

●	Real-world automation

●	Tasks with uncertainty

This limitation is the reason Agentic AI exists.
________________________________________
2. The Core Shift: Who Controls the Flow? 
Traditional software:
●	Developers control execution

●	Logic is predefined

●	Programs do not decide what to do next

Agentic systems:
●	The model influences the next action

●	Execution is decision-driven

●	The system adapts based on results

This is the key technical shift:
Agentic AI introduces probabilistic control flow into software systems.
The program no longer says:
“Do A, then B, then C.”
It says:
“Here is the goal. Decide the next step.”
This is powerful — and dangerous — if not engineered properly.
________________________________________
3. Why Chatbots Are Not Agents
A chatbot:
●	Responds once

●	Ends interaction

●	Cannot recover from failure

An agent:
●	Operates in loops

●	Maintains state

●	Observes consequences

●	Tries again if needed

The difference is not intelligence.
 It is architecture.
Aspect	Chatbot	Agent
Execution	Single-turn	Multi-step
State	Temporary	Persistent
Tools	Optional	Core
Failure	Terminal	Recoverable
If a system cannot fail, observe, and retry, it is not an agent.
________________________________________
4. The Agent Loop 
At a technical level, every agent reduces to a loop:
1.	Receive a goal

2.	Observe current state

3.	Decide the next action

4.	Execute using tools

5.	Observe the result

6.	Continue or stop

This loop is the smallest unit of agency.
Everything else — memory, planning, tools — exists to make this loop stable and safe.
Without this loop:
●	There is no autonomy

●	There is no ownership

●	There is no agent

________________________________________
5. Why This Matters in Real Applications
Agentic systems are not built for demos.
 They are built for operational tasks.
Examples:
●	Automated incident response

●	Research assistants that run for hours

●	AI dev tools that modify code, test, and retry

●	Support systems that escalate intelligently

All of these require:
●	Memory

●	Tool usage

●	Decision-making across time

This is why Agentic AI is closer to systems engineering than prompt writing.
________________________________________
6. A Gentle Technical Glimpse 
Today, we will only preview, not deep-dive.
Students will see:
●	How an LLM behaves as a plain function

●	Why structure matters

●	Why retries are needed

The takeaway is not code mastery.
 The takeaway is this realization:
“A single LLM call cannot be trusted to run a system.”
That insight sets up everything that follows.
________________________________________
7. What This Course Will Gradually Build 
Over the next weeks, students will learn to:
●	Convert LLMs into decision-makers

●	Add memory and state

●	Introduce planning and reflection

●	Coordinate multiple agents

●	Build production-style AI systems

Not immediately.
 Not magically.
 Step by step.
________________________________________
8. End-of-Class Anchor Thought 
Chatbots answer.
 Agents operate.
 Systems survive.
This course is about building the third category.

 
Day 2 
PART 1: THEORY 
1. Why We Start With Data 
In AI, intelligence does not start with models.
 It starts with what the system is allowed to observe.
Data defines:
●	What patterns can be learned

●	What decisions are even possible

●	What errors will silently propagate

Later, when we build agents:
●	Agents will observe data

●	Agents will reason over observations

●	Agents will act based on that reasoning

If the data layer is weak, autonomy amplifies mistakes.
________________________________________
2. What “Data” Means in AI (System View)
Data is not just “input”.
In AI systems, data is:
●	The representation of reality

●	A compressed view of the world

●	Always incomplete and biased

Key idea to stress:
AI systems never see reality.
 They see data-shaped reality.
________________________________________
3. Types of Data You’ll Actually Work With
Structured Data
●	Tables, CSVs, databases

●	Fixed columns and types

●	Easy to validate

●	Easy to misuse

Examples:
●	User records

●	Transactions

●	Logs

Unstructured Data
●	Text, documents, messages

●	No fixed schema

●	High ambiguity

●	Primary input for LLMs later

Important forward link:
Agentic systems often combine structured data (state, logs)
 with unstructured data (text, instructions).
________________________________________
4. Why Raw Data Is Never Used Directly
Raw data is:
●	Incomplete

●	Inconsistent

●	Noisy

●	Full of hidden assumptions

Models do not learn from reality.
 They learn from processed representations.
Therefore:
●	Cleaning is part of intelligence

●	Preprocessing decisions shape behavior

●	Ignoring this leads to false confidence

________________________________________
5. A Critical Concept: Data Leakage (Light, Conceptual)
Data leakage happens when:
●	Information from the future leaks into training data

●	Models appear accurate but fail in practice

Why this matters later:
●	Agents trust their observations

●	If observations are contaminated, planning collapses

●	The system becomes confidently wrong

Key line:
Bad data creates intelligent-looking failures.
________________________________________
PART 2: PRACTICAL (30–35 minutes, VS Code)
Objective of Today’s Practical
●	Set up the course workspace

●	Load and inspect data

●	Identify data quality issues

●	Make explicit decisions, not silent assumptions

No ML yet. No AI yet. This is intentional.
________________________________________
Step 1: Create Course Workspace (5 minutes)
Open VS Code → Terminal
mkdir agentic_course
cd agentic_course

Explain:
This folder will stay with us for the entire program.
________________________________________
Step 2: Create Foundations Folder
mkdir 01_data_foundations
cd 01_data_foundations
mkdir day02_data_basics
cd day02_data_basics

Final path:
agentic_course/01_data_foundations/day02_data_basics

________________________________________
Step 3: Create Virtual Environment (One-Time)
python -m venv venv

Activate:
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

Explain briefly:
●	This isolates dependencies

●	Prevents conflicts later when we add AI libraries

________________________________________
Step 4: Install Required Libraries
pip install pandas numpy

Explain:
●	numpy → numerical foundation

●	pandas → structured data handling
